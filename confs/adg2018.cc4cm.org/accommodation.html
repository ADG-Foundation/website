		 <p style="margin-top:0px;">
		We have reserved some rooms of <a href="http://www.landmarkhotel.com.cn/en/">Landmark Hotel</a> (conference venue) and another two hotels for parcitipants of the conference. The prices may be higher than usual due to the 15th China-ASEAN Exposition to be held in Nanning from September 12 to September 15, 2018. If you are willing to book a room of the recommended hotels, please remark that on the <a href="registration.html">registration</a> form. The Landmark Hotel is close to Exit D of LUBANLU station, Nanning Metro Line 1. There are also some other hotels nearby and you can book your preferred hotels by yourself. Anyway you'd better book your hotels as early as possible in case of tight hotel supplies.</p>
		  
		<p style="margin-top:0px;"> The Nanning Wuxu International Airport is about 34 km away from the conference venue (Landmark Hotel). It is recommdended to take a taxi to your hotel. If you arrive on September 10 and would like to have assistance at the airport, please inform <a  href="mailto:yangjing0930@gmail.com">Jing Yang</a> the time of your arrival with flight number. Someone will meet you at the airport and help ask a taxi to send you to your hotel (in this case, you should look for someone holding your name at the exit of the arrival hall).
		 </p>
		 <p style="margin-top:0px;">The taxi fares in Nanning are quite affordable and you pay exactly the amount shown on the taximeter. It costs about 140 CNY from the Airport to the hotel. It is recommended to keep the receipt, which could help you find the driver when necessary. You may print the following note and show it to taxi driver.

		  have a try. Another possibility is to go to restaurants in
		  star-ranked hotels, where the waiters can speak English. Otherwise,
		  there are McDonald's and KFC in various places. Here you get what you
		  know and the prices is usually lower than in other countries.
