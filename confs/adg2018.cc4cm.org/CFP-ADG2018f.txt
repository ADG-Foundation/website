About ADG
=========
 ADG is a forum dedicated to the exchange of ideas and views, to the 
 presentation of research results and progress, and to the demonstration 
 of software tools on the intersection between geometry, computation, 
 and automated reasoning. ADG organizes a workshop every two years. 
 The previous editions were held in Strasbourg (France) 2016, Coimbra 
 (Portugal) 2014, Edinburgh (UK) 2012, Munich (Germany) 2010, Shanghai 
 (China) 2008, Pontevedra (Spain) 2006, Gainesville (USA) 2004, Linz 
 (Austria) 2002, Zurich (Switzerland) 2000, Beijing (China) 1998, and 
 Toulouse (France) 1996.

 The twelfth conference ADG 2018 will take place in Nanning, China, from
 September 11 to September 14, 2018, in memory of Wen-tsün Wu, founder 
 of the Chinese school of mathematics mechanization. 

Aim and Scope 
============= 
 ADG 2018 aims at gathering researchers, engineers, and others interested
 in exploring methods for automated reasoning and symbolic computation in 
 geometry, to discuss theoretical and practical challenges, and to present 
 recent research progress and results dedicated (not exhausted) in 

  - polynomial algebra, invariant and coordinate-free methods, probabilistic, 
    synthetic, and logic approaches, techniques for automated geometric 
    reasoning from discrete mathematics, combinatorics, and numerics;
  - symbolic and numeric methods for geometric computation, geometric constraint 
    solving, automated generation/reasoning and manipulation with diagrams;
  - design and implementation of geometry software, special-purpose tools, 
    automated theorem provers, experimental studies;
  - applications of ADG to mechanics, geometric modeling, CAGD/CAD, computer 
    vision, robotics, and education.

Important Dates 
=============== 

  - Deadline for extended abstract/full paper submission    June 15, 2018 (extended)
  - Notification on all papers				    July 15, 2018 
  - Camera-ready submission				    July 31, 2018 
  - Early registration deadline				    August 1, 2018 
  - Conference taking place				    September 11-14, 2018 


Submission Guideline 
====================
 Original research papers in English, including experimental work and 
 work in progress, are welcome. The following two types of submissions
 are invited:

 (1) Full paper: maximum 20 pages
 (2) Extended abstract addressing the following aspects explicitly:
     - Problem: what is the problem/question/objective?
     - Motivation: why do we work on the problem and what is the importance?
     - State of the art: what has been done already on the problem?
     - Contribution: what is the main original contribution?
     - Main idea: what is the main idea underlying the contribution?

 Submissions should follow the standard Springer LNCS Proceedings format. 
 Electronic submission as PDF is required via EasyChair at 

            http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adg2018. 

 If you have any problem with the submission of your paper, or questions 
 concerning ADG 2018 or EasyChair, please contact chenxiaoyu@buaa.edu.cn. 
 At least one author of each accepted submission must register at ADG 2018. 
   
Refereeing and Publication
==========================
 The submitted contributions will be subject to a summary review by the Program 
 Committee, bearing in mind that this first review is mainly for presentation, 
 NOT for publication. Digital publication of the full papers/extended abstracts
 accepted for presentation will be available at the conference. The authors of the 
 full papers/extended abstracts accepted for presentation at the conference will be 
 invited to submit their full and/or revised papers for publication in a formal 
 proceedings of ADG 2018 after the conference. The full papers (submitted after the 
 conference) will be formally reviewed by PC members and external referees. All 
 participants are encouraged to bring along posters on their work (irrespective
 of whether it was presented at the conference or not) for display during ADG 2018.

 The accepted full papers will be published as a special issue of some journal or 
 in the Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series or Lecture 
 Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. The proceedings of ADG 1996, ADG 1998, 
 ADG 2000, ADG 2002, ADG 2004, ADG 2006, ADG 2010, ADG 2012, and ADG 2014 appeared
 as LNAI 1360, LNAI 1669, LNAI 2061, LNAI 2930, LNAI 3763, LNAI 4869, LNCS 6877,
 LNAI 7993, and LNAI 9201, respectively.
