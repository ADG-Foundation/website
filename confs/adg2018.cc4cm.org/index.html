<p>ADG is a forum dedicated to the exchange of ideas and views, to the 
 presentation of research results and progress, and to the demonstration 
 of software tools on the intersection between geometry, computation, 
 and automated reasoning. ADG organized a workshop every two years.

 <p> The twelfth conference ADG 2018 will take place in Nanning, China, from
 September 11 to September 14, 2018, in memory of Wen-ts&uuml;n Wu, founder 
 of the Chinese school of mathematics mechanization.</p>
<h3 id="scope">Aim and Scope</h3>
<p>ADG 2018 aims at gathering researchers, engineers, and others interested
 in exploring methods for automated reasoning and symbolic computation in 
 geometry, to discuss theoretical and practical challenges, and to present 
 recent research progress and results dedicated (not exhausted) in 
<ul>
  <li> polynomial algebra, invariant and coordinate-free methods, probabilistic, 
    synthetic, and logic approaches, techniques for automated geometric 
    reasoning from discrete mathematics, combinatorics, and numerics;</li>
  <li> symbolic and numeric methods for geometric computation, geometric constraint 
    solving, automated generation/reasoning and manipulation with diagrams;</li>
  <li> design and implementation of geometry software, special-purpose tools, 
    automated theorem provers, experimental studies;</li>
  <li> applications of ADG to mechanics, geometric modeling, CAGD/CAD, computer 
    vision, robotics, and education.</li></p>

	<p><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jdf">Jacques Fleuriot</a> (University of Edinburgh, UK)</br>Interactive Theorem Proving in Geometry: From Foundations to Applications</p>
	<p>In this talk, I乫ll argue that interactive theorem proving is an effective tool for the systematic investigation of geometric problems, ranging from axiomatic foundations to formal verification. This type of mechanization is usually carried out within the settings of proof-assistants such as Isabelle, which provide both a rich language for formalizing non-trivial concepts, e.g. higher-order geometric axioms or even inductive definitions, and an array of powerful automated tools, e.g. first order theorem provers and decision procedures, that can help the user in their quest for a (readable) proof. 
	</p>
	<p>I will illustrate the above by discussing some of the achievements from the past twenty years, a number of which were originally presented at Automated Deduction in Geometry. Time permitting, I乫ll also talk about some potential mechanization challenges and avenues for collaborative proof efforts in geometry.

	<p>
	In this talk, I will give a review of some of the major advances in the field of mathematics mechanization coined by  Wen-ts&uuml;n Wu. 
These include the Ritt-Wu characteristic set method for symbolic solution of algebraic, differential, and difference polynomial equation systems; methods for automated proving and discovering geometry theorems; and applications in computer aided geometric design, computer vision, robotics, etc.

Hard Combinatorial Problems via SAT</p>

<p>The area of boolean satisfiability and SAT solvers has seen dramatic advances in the past two decades. A recent trend in SAT solving is an attempt to combine the strengths of symbolic computation tools with the power of SAT solvers, in order to improve their effectiveness and to build custom-tailored SAT solvers for hard combinatorial problems. We will describe our work in this context, with a focus on some particularly hard combinatorial problems, described via autocorrelation of finite sequences.</p>

<p>Based on joint work with Vijay Ganesh (University of Waterloo) and Curtis Bright (University of Waterloo) in the context of the Horizon 2020 EU project "Satisfiability Checking and Symbolic Computation" (SC^2).</p>

	<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pascalschreck/">Pascal Schreck</a> (University of Strasbourg, France)</br>Around Dandelin-Gallucci Theorem </p> 
	<p>This talk is about mechanization of projective incidence geometry. I present some parts of a work which began in 2004 with a proposal of Dominique Michelucci about the so-called hexamys and a study around combinatorial proofs in incidence geometry. Most of this presentation relates to joint works with other members of the Strasbourg team and especially David Braun and Nicolas Magaud. After a brief description of projective incidence geometry, and after recalling the importance of both Desargues and Pappus theorems, I explain how projective incidence geometries correspond to a certain class of matroids. Then, I present Dandelin-Gallucci theorem with several proofs using very different approaches: combinatoric algebra, synthetic geometry, matroids, ...</p>
  	
    <p><a href="http://www.mmrc.iss.ac.cn/~dwang/">Dingkang Wang</a> (Chinese Academy of Sciences, China)</br>Comprehensive Gröbner Systems and Discovering Geometric Theorems Mechanically</p>
	<p>
	For many geometric theorems, the hypotheses can be represented by a system of parametric polynomial equations and the conclusion can be represented by a parametric polynomial equation. An important problem concerning proving geometric theorems is to determine whether a geometric statement is valid under a specialization of parameters. Comprehensive Gröbner system is an important tool to solve the problem related to parametric polynomial system. We will review the progresses in comprehensive Gröbner systems and then use it to discover geometric theorems mechanically, i.e., we can find out complementary conditions on the parameters such that the geometric statement becomes true or true on components.

	 <p>
	Everybody knows that identical regular triangles or squares can tile the whole plane. Many people know that identical regular hexagons can tile the plane properly as well. In fact, even the bees know and use this fact! Is there any other convex domain which can tile the Euclidean plane? Of course, there is a long list of them! To find the list and to show the completeness of the list is a unique drama in mathematics, which has lasted for more than one century and the completeness of the list has been mistakenly announced not only once! Up to now, the list consists of triangles, quadrilaterals, fifteen types of pentagons, and three types of hexagons. In 2017, Michael Rao announced a computer proof for the completeness of the list. Meanwhile, Qi Yang and Chuanming Zong made a series of unexpected discoveries in multiple tilings in the Euclidean plane. For examples, besides parallelograms and centrally symmetric hexagons, there is no other convex domain which can form any two-, three- or four-fold translative tiling in the plane. However, there are two types of octagons and one type of decagons which can form nontrivial five-fold translative tilings. Furthermore, a convex domain can form a five-fold translative tiling of the plane if and only if it can form a five-fold lattice tiling. In this talk we will report these progresses.
