<h2>Second International Workshop<br>on</h2><p> 
<h1>Automated Deduction in Geometry</h1>
<h4>Beijing, China, August 1-3, 1998</h4>
</center><p> 
<hr> <p>
The second international workshop on Automated Deduction in Geometry
(ADG '98) will be held in Beijing, China, August 1-3, 1998. The first 
ADG workshop - ADG '96 - was held in Toulouse, France in 1996, and its 
proceedings appeared as volume 1360 in Springer-Verlag's LNAI series. 
We hope to publish the proceedings of ADG '98 in the same LNAI series.  
<p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>
Research activities continue to contribute various powerful techniques 
(synthetic, analytic, algebraic, logic, numerical, etc.) and tools for 
automated geometric deduction. The main objective of ADG '98 is to bring 
together active researchers on the subject to review the current state 
of the art, to report research results and progress, and to exchange 
ideas for future developments and cooperation. Special attention will 
be paid to the interaction of the subject with other disciplines and its 
potential industrial applications in geometric modeling, CAGD/CAD, 
computer vision, and robotics. 
<p>
<h3>Workshop site</h3>
<p>
ADG '98 will be hosted by the Mathematics Mechanization Research Center 
(MMRC) of Academia Sinica, where Wu's method was born. MMRC has been 
known in particular for its research accomplishments on automated geometry 
theorem proving. Beijing offers numerous places of cultural and historical 
interest for domestic and foreign visitors. The workshop participants may 
also take the opportunity for sightseeing and to view recent impressive 
developments elsewhere in China. 
<p>
<h3>Program</h3>
<p>
The program of ADG '98 will feature a keynote talk by Prof. Wen-ts&uuml;n 
Wu, an invited lecture by Prof. Jing-Zhong Zhang, and original technical 
presentations. Sufficient time slots will 
be reserved for informal discussion and exchange of new ideas. 
<p>
<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>
All speakers at the workshop will be by invitation, and the number is 
limited to 25. However, potential participants are encouraged to contact 
the organizers. All attendees are asked to be responsible for their own 
travel and lodging expenses.
