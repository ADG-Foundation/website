<h2>About Belgrade</h2>

<p>
Belgrade is the capital and the largest city of Serbia. The city lies at the
confluence of Sava and Danube rivers. With a population of almost two million, Belgrade is the third largest city
in Southeastern Europe. The architecture of Belgrade is a mirror of different cultural and historical periods,
influences and styles: from old Oriental influences, across baroque architecture, secession, academism and
neoclassicism, socialist and industrial features from post WW2 period, to modern architecture and layout of New
Belgrade with wide boulevards. Knez Mihajlova Street is the main walking street in Belgrade. It is a pedestrian
zone, protected by law as one of the most valuable monumental complexes of the city. Belgrade has many
beautiful parks and the biggest one is Kalemegdan, with an old fortress, comprising remains from Ancient and
Byzantine times to Turkish and Austro–Ugrian periods. Belgrade has more than 20 theatres and two opera
houses and it is home to a number of film, theater, and music festivals. There are many excellent restaurants,
cafés and pubs, and British Times proclaimed Belgrade as Europe’s best nightlife city.

<h2>Accommodation</h2>

<p>
There are many nice hotels near the conference venue, and the participants are free to choose the one that fits them best. 
However, we managed to arrange some special offers for ADG participants, and we list them in the following text as our
recommendations.
</p>

<h3>Belgrade Inn Hotel</h3>

<p>
We have made a special agreement with  <a href="https://belgradeinn.com/">Belgrade Inn Hotel</a>, a small, casual hotel in the city center, 
offering to ADG participants economy single rooms with breakfast for 60 euros and double rooms with breakfast for 80 euros 
per night (taxes not included).
</p>

<p> 
Reservation can be made
<a href="https://secure.phobs.net/booking.php?company_id=0eb0ca421d3a252f79a72e98da231ba6&hotel=4ec6bda2f26babef304e4312d22fd56c&partners_access=PMF&date=2023-09-19">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Student hostel "Kod Vuka"</h3>
<p>
We also made a reservation with a nice student hostel, approximately 3km distance 
from the conference venue, offering single rooms with breakfast for approximately 40 euros 
and double rooms with breakfast for approximately 25 euros per night. The hostel is 
located within "Kralj Aleksandar I" student dormitory, near the monument of Vuk Karadžić, 
in one of the most beautiful Belgrade parks, and on one of the Belgrade's most famous boulevards. 
</p>
<p>
The number of pre-booked rooms is limited. Both reservations are valid until the beginning of August. 
Reservation for the hostel can be made via Vesna Marinković (<a href="mailto:vesna.marinkovic@matf.bg.ac.rs">vesna.marinkovic@matf.bg.ac.rs</a>).

<h2>Conference Venue</h2>

<p>
The conference is organized by the Faculty of Mathematics, a member of the University of Belgrade, which is the oldest and 
the most significant university in Serbia. The roots of the University of Belgrade can be found in the College founded by 
Dositej Obradović in 1808, during the First Serbian uprising against the Ottoman Empire. The College ceased to exist after the 
uprising collapsed, and it was re-founded thirty years later, in the liberated Serbia, under the name of Lyceum. It received the 
status of university in 1905, in then Kingdom of Serbia. Since then, it is the most prominent educational and scientific 
institution in the country, now consisting of 31 faculties and 11 scientific institutes.  
</p>

<p>
Although the Faculty of Mathematics formally exists as a separate member of the University of Belgrade only since 1995, the history of mathematical
education at the university is much longer, and it dates back to the Lyceum period, in the middle of 19th century.
The first department of mathematics was founded in 1873. During the first half of the 20th century, the department was a part of the 
Faculty of Philosophy, until it became a part of the new-founded Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics in 1947. Finally, in 1995, 
the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics was reorganized into several distinct faculties, one of which is the Faculty of Mathematics.
</p>

<p>
Today, the Faculty of Mathematics is a modern educational institution, organizing undergraduate, master and doctoral programs in 
several different areas of mathematics, astronomy and computer science. The faculty is also involved in the scientific research
in many fields, such as mathematical analysis, algebra, geometry, statistics, optimization, machine learning, bioinformatics, 
automated reasoning, etc.
</p>

<p>
The Faculty of Mathematics is located in the very center of Belgrade, close to Kalemegdan fortress, and to the confluence of the 
rivers Danube and Sava. The main pedestrian street, Knez Mihajlova, is just about 250m from the faculty building. 
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The conference will be held at the nearby hotel Palace (only about 600m from the faculty building).

<h2>Travel Information</h2>

<h3>Visa information</h3>

<p> 
Before you travel to Serbia, you should check for visa and other requirements for entering the 
country. The detailed information can be found at the 
<a href="https://www.mfa.gov.rs/en/citizens/travel-serbia">official website</a> of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the Republic of Serbia.
</p>

<h3>Travel by plane</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://beg.aero/eng">Belgrade Airport</a> is located about 18km west of the city center. At the arrivals 
hall there are car rentals, a 24-hour exchange office and several ATMs.
</p>

<p>
In order to reach the city center, the simplest way is to get a taxi ride directly to the hotel or hostel where you will be
staying. There is a Taxi information stand at the international arrivals hall of the Belgrade airport. 
If you wish to take a taxi to your destination, go to this stand and state your destination. You will be given a voucher 
with the price you will have to pay the taxi driver once you get to your destination. There are 6 zones with prices ranging 
from RSD 2.300 to 9.900 (around €20-85). The Faculty of Mathematics and its surroundings (likely including your accommodation place) 
is located in the Zone 2, so the expected taxi price should be RSD 3,000 (around €25). Once you obtain the voucher, exit the 
building and get the taxi. When you get to your destination, pay the taxi driver the fee stated in the voucher.
</p>

<p>
Another way of reaching the city center (assuming you are not renting a car) is by using the public transportation:

<ul>
 <li>Bus line 72: you can use it to reach the stop <em>Zeleni Venac</em> (the final stop), which is about 200m from the city center. 
 The price is RSD 150 (around €1,30, tickets can be purchased on the bus). </li>
 <li>Shuttle bus A1 (mini bus): you can use it to reach the stop <em>Savski Trg</em>, which is about 1km from the city center. 
 The price is RSD 300 (around €2,60, tickets can be purchased on the bus). </li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>Travel by car</h3>
<p>
Belgrade lies at the intersection of E-70 and E-75 motorways. Foreign drivers in Serbia need 
an international driving license, vehicle registration certificate and insurance policy. 
The valid insurance policies are issued by the signatory countries of the Vehicle Insurance 
Convention and citizens of other countries are required to buy an insurance policy on entering 
Serbia. You cannot miss Belgrade, because the motorway runs through the city. The speed limit 
in the city is set at 50 km/h unless otherwise indicated by speed signs. Alcohol consumption
is not allowed when driving.
